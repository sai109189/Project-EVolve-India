# ⚡ Project E-Volve India — Data-Driven EV Policy Framework

Data-Driven Framework for Policy Formulation in India's Electric Mobility Transition (Power BI + Python Project) 


### 🧭 Overview
Project **E-Volve India** is a Power BI + Python-based analytical framework designed to support government policymakers in accelerating India’s electric vehicle (EV) transition.  
It transforms raw Vahan & mParivahan data into actionable insights for EV adoption, infrastructure planning, and FAME-II policy optimization.
